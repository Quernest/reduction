      "title": "What is reduction?",
      "description": "In statistics, machine learning, and information theory, dimensionality reduction or dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.",

        "title": "Principal Component Analysis",
        "description": "A statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.",

Two of them (wines) describes five wines described by the average ratings of a set of experts on their hedonic dimension, how much the wine goes with dessert, and how much the wine goes with meat. Each wine is also described by its price, its sugar and alcohol content, and its acidity. Another describes gross state product from Lattin, Carroll, and Green (2003). Data are for 50 observations (U.S. states) and 13 categories (ag, mining, trade, etc.) for the gross state product expressed as shares."
